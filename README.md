# What is QuickForm?

**QuickForm** is a blazor component which allows quick creation of **downright gorgeous** HTML forms
with **minimal** effort.
While the component is dead simple, it does not sacrifice customization!

# Who is QuickForm for?

**QuickForm is for Developers who value their time**.
those who do not wish to spend their precious hours writing boilerplate for forms.

I created this library to solve my own problems, to solve my own time.
But with time, it quickly grew into a passionate project which I believe will save a lot of dev-hours for a lot of web developers.
