# Validation

QuickForm has two types of validation

- Microsoft's `DataAnnotationsValidator`
- `Blazored.FluentValidationValidator`

## Before you start

Make sure that:

- QuickForm package is added to your project.
- QuickForm is properly imported.
- You have your fluent validation properly set up.

## DataAnnotation Validation

There are many data annotation attributes supported for validation,
most built-into C#, but some specific to QuickForm

Please refer to the [Customizing with attributes](attribute-customization.md) section for more 
information about supported attributes
